"July 26, 2021","""I want to explain to you about the fraudulent vaccination of the fraud government. This is life-saving information except that I ask you to share this post. The state must wake up.
**
We have already defeated the corona once, brought millions of vaccines before any other country, and were the first in the world to emerge from the corona.
In order for Israel to continue to defeat the corona, another two million vaccines must be brought to Israel, and it is impossible for Israeli citizens over the age of 50 to obtain the third search.
It will save lives, maintain health and maintain an open and prosperous economy.
**
Understand - we have already paid for these vaccines. We bought millions of vaccines. The Israeli ads have millions of vaccines that are now being criticized and the government does not understand it to Israel.
This is an unbelievable omission. When they decide to bring them in, it's time for people to stick to harsh prices, others to die.
You need to bring these searches now and give the third search to the risk groups and the quality structure of the firm.
**
Even if the government wants to wait for more people, there is no reason not to bring the searches right now to save time (long weeks - thousands of sick and dead) and give the vaccines as soon as possible.
**
Instead of giving jobs to Yair Golan and Eli Avidar, instead of bringing a Norwegian flood to the Knesset, the state must do the right thing to make the third search.
Why?
Bring the millions of vaccines - now! """,Benjamin Netanyahu - בנימין נתניהו,FAKE,1
"July 26, 2021",The government is responsible for the failure of vaccines. We bought millions of vaccines that are now sitting in Europe because the government is not bringing them in now. They distribute jobs instead of distributing the third vaccine to Israeli citizens - that is the only way to save lives and keep the economy open. Get the vaccine right away!,Benjamin Netanyahu - בנימין נתניהו,FAKE,2
"July 25, 2021","Likud:
It took only a month and a half for this bad government to erase important achievements we have made over the years and endanger the State of Israel and its citizens.
We took Israel out of the corona for the first time in the world - and they returned the corona to Israel.
We stopped Iran from reaching a nuclear bomb and uncovered Iran's secret nuclear archive - and they agreed to a ""no surprises"" policy with the United States, thereby undermining Israel's independence from the Iranian nuclear program.
Now, according to media reports, they have broken a new record. According to the report, Russia is working to restrict the IDF's freedom of action in the skies of Syria in the face of Iranian targets in the region.
We maintained freedom of action in Syria thanks to the close relations between Netanyahu and Putin, which ensured the security of Israel and its residents. If the report is correct, the failed government has lost another vital strategic asset that Israel enjoyed during the Netanyahu government, thus exposing us to another danger.

"July 28, 2021","The city of Ashdod is getting vaccinated!
The wonderful and performing mayor Yehiel Lasri has now updated me on Ashdod's immunization campaign:
He opened vaccine complexes himself - and it just works.
In four vaccination campaigns, they vaccinated over 4,700 residents (ages 18+).
While vaccinating children aged 12-16 -> they vaccinated another 650 children!
And tonight they are holding vaccination campaigns in two areas - general and ultra-Orthodox.
-
And here is the result:
In Ashdod, vaccinated over the age of 50 - 91%
Ages 16-19 vaccinated and recovering - 89%!
Ages 12-15: Vaccinated and recovering - 38%

- Yesterday I visited the ""Nofim"" nursing home in Jerusalem, together with the Ministers of Welfare and Social Equality, to take a closer look at the move we are making to protect the elderly and vulnerable from the corona.
I handle this personally and receive a daily report on the subject.
The Israeli government is currently providing the strongest protection in the world to about 120,000 elderly people in geriatric hospitals and nursing homes.
Every Israeli citizen can be proud of this miraculous course.
The rest of the adults in Israel are responsible for being more careful and taking care of themselves: meeting the grandchildren outside, in the open air, with masks.
We all take care of grandpa and grandma! 🇮🇱

The Foreign Ministry's top appointments committee today completed a round of appointments. Out of 27 appointments, there will be 19 women. Some - still not enough - in senior positions.
Next week, a special team will be set up in the office to encourage women to apply for the position of heads of missions abroad.
This is an ongoing and important work of the firm's management and the appointments committee.

"July 15, 2021","""Congratulations to the IDF,"" after 73 years of existence and many male generals, the Chief of Staff appointed a second champion, Yifat Tomer Yerushalmi.
Now any girl who wants a military career can see that she can be a champion. Because what you can not see is very difficult for you to be.
But you still can not see a champion coming from the field troops, the command broadcaster that starts with the combat units, the spearhead units. And you can not be this champion, because these units are still completely closed to every girl. You still cannot distinguish 8% from the IDF, for the positions from which the rest of the masses of generals grew.
That is why I have been demanding for years from the Minister of Defense and the Chief of Staff that everyone be able to differentiate into any position in the army, that the sorting be done according to skills and abilities and not according to gender and gender. Because there can be no equality in the duty of service but inequality in opportunities. Nor can the IDF waste talented manpower with motivation just because it clings to old chauvinism.
So another IDF champion is great, and we wish all the success to the Yifat Tomer Yerushalmi cell, and wish ourselves and the chief of staff Aviv Kochavi and Defense Minister Gantz to join the present, where women are human beings.

"July 26, 2021","""The Mechanical Orange - The Eritrean Version.
Under the public and media radar, a shocking and brutal rape case took place last week of an Eritrean infiltrator who brutally assaulted an elderly woman in south Tel Aviv.
According to the police description, the suspect took a kettle that was at the scene, slapped the victim on the head and caused it to break in the eye sockets - and also bit her in the body while he raped her and held a knife to her neck.
Where are the left-wing MKs who always want to protect underprivileged women? silence! Where is the Minister of Public Security? silence! Tweeting about sexual harassment in the modeling world (an important but one of many topics), has time, but assaulting a woman in south Tel Aviv. What about him and that ?! It's from him onwards .. Diligent Monastery is diligent!
What about some instruction to set up an investigation team to investigate the failures of the rendering attempt? Maybe even send more police reinforcements to the southern Tel Aviv area so that the residents feel a little safer and can maybe sleep a little better at night?

"July 15, 2021","49 - People of the Land of Israel - For!
61 - Members of the First Palestinian Government - Against!
The ""first Palestinian government,"" as Ahmad Tibi defined it, overthrew the basic immigration bill I submitted. The proposal is the only legal way that will make it possible through a few steps to preserve here a Jewish state with a solid Jewish majority for future generations.
✔️Immediately arrange and return all illegal infiltrators and their families to detention facilities until they are deported from Israel to their country of origin and / or to a third country, and detain anyone who objects to it indefinitely.
✔️Permanent ban on the immigration of illegal infiltrators and family reunification in Israel.
✔️Re-examination of all immigration permits issued to Arab Arabs and the Gaza Strip over the years.
Shortly before the government - unsurprisingly - the vote thief rejected the proposal that would once and for all set a clear and orderly immigration policy for Israel, Interior Minister Ayelet Shaked fled (as is customary in this group) the truth that she should have heard and sent Yoaz Handel instead to answer nonsense and clearly irrelevant arguments. . My remarks have, of course, been repeatedly interrupted by supporters of the joint terrorism and I have not had a chance to say the whole thing, but nonetheless, I will continue to fight with all my might for the advancement of the law. We will do this very soon from the coalition benches!
Of course you should not be surprised that you did not hear anything about the fake right that voted yesterday against the Basic Law on Immigration to Israel in most of the institutionalized media, but that's fine, for that we have (for now) the right to bring you the truth here on social media.

21 אפר׳ 2021,"""Not all of them flew over Herzl's vision of the Jewish state at the time. Absolutely not. In fact, the vision was considered absurd and Herzl was ridiculed and derided. But that did not stop him. And the rest is history.
But history is not over, and the vision still demands completion. That's why we're here.
Herzl's vision for the Jewish state, written in his book 125 years ago, is far from perfect. It lacks the word """" equality """" and the only times women are mentioned are pregnancy and childbirth ties, or as something that has to be ""given and taken"" for the future of the nation.
The State of Israel, which was established on the basis of the same vision, still lacks equality. Economic equality, social equality, civic equality, gender equality and equality as a basic premise for modern society. In 2021, after too many years of divisive and inciting rule, we are far and away from achieving equality. But why are visions intended if not to fulfill them?
Just as there were those who raised an eyebrow at Herzl's vision, so today there are those who raise an eyebrow at my vision, a vision of a state that is democratic, but no less so, a Jewish state, a state that seeks peace with its neighbors on the basis of agreements, and a state that sees citizenship and citizens Its sons and daughters with human life and desires and needs.
"""" We do not discriminate between people. We do not ask what a person's religion is, and what race he belongs to. He must be a human being and by that we say quite """", Herzl wrote in his later book """" Altneuland """". Herzl progressed between the ""Jewish State"" and this book, and we too will progress from this rule to a better one.
Visions are born out of crises, and today, my vision for the future of the country is more relevant than ever. Because in my vision, citizenship and citizens are the main thing, and not elected officials. In my vision, social services are strong and stable so that they can be used by those who are meant to be used - society. Discourse is a clean and fair discourse that represents truth and transparency, respect for our sons is a cornerstone and we see and see the woman and man before the sector, sector or group to which he or she belongs.
In my vision we are dealing - and dealing! - In the future of the girls and boys who will live here, while caring for the day-to-day needs of life itself, here and now.
""If you will, this is not a legend,"" he said. And now more than ever, if you will, we can do better here. All it takes is one, brave, step towards change.
If we want, it is neither a legend nor a dream, nor a fantasy nor an imagination, our ability to live in the state of Judaism and the Jews in security, equality and respect is possible. We just have to believe in it, want it and act for it.
