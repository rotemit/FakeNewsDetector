# FakeNewsDetector

Hello! Welcome to our FakeNewsDetector, the ultimate tool for Fake News Detection in Hebrew politics on Facebook,
created as a final project for our Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

In order to run our project, you will need to create a virtual environment and run pip install to the following libraries:
- nltk      - matplotlib      - pandas      - facebook_scraper      - numpy       - selenium      - sklearn     - flask?     -React?
(optimally, when we finish the project try to run on a different computer and update readme accordingly)

probably need to download YAP, if so add explanation about this.
